# Mark Drummond — ✨Full-Stack Web Developer✨

I'm a thirty-something new dad from Kansas City, now living in Seattle and following my passion as a full-stack web developer. I have independent, freelance, and team development experience creating full-stack web apps, mobile-responsive websites, and content management systems for clients big and small. I want to work with your farmer's market stand, small business, university department, or development firm to create a meaningful product that meets your customers' needs, as well as your own. Contact me today to discuss your next website!
